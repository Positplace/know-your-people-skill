## Data Location

All contact files live in `~/.clawbot/workspace/people/` - inside the workspace. On first use, create it: `mkdir -p ~/.clawbot/workspace/people/`

## Owner self-entry

The owner's own contact file (slug derived from `.peopleconfig.yml` `owner` field without .md) is intentional — it's used as a reference profile for crafting introductions, bios, and context when introducing the user to others.

## Actions File

`~/.clawbot/worspace/people/actions.md` — the pending actions queue. Check this during morning briefings.

- **Catch-ups:** people `owner` wants to reconnect with. Add when he says "we should catch up with David" or similar.
- **Introductions:** intros to facilitate. Always include a pre-generated draft intro message (using ilya-belikin.md + both contact files for context). Format: `Person A → Person B — reason` followed by the intro text as a plain indented paragraph (no "Draft:" label, no quotes, no formatting).
- Move completed items to `## Completed` with a date.
- Keep it short — if it's not actionable, it shouldn't be here.

### Housekeeping (run automatically when reading actions.md)

To keep context lean as the file grows:

- **Completed items:** delete after 3 days
- **Completed section:** rolling 7-day window — anything older than 7 days is removed
- **Stale catch-ups:** if a pending catch-up has been sitting for 10+ days with no update, move it to Completed as "(not pursued)" with today's date
- **Pending intros:** keep until explicitly marked done or cancelled — intro intent doesn't expire
- Apply this cleanup silently on every read. No need to announce.

## Dataset Config — `.peopleconfig.yml`

`~/.clawbot/workspace/people/.peopleconfig.yml` is the dataset config file. Read it at the start of any session involving this skill.

```yaml
owner: jane-smith # slug of the owner's contact file (without .md)

# Enclave is optional — only needed if you join peepsapp.ai
enclaves: []
endpoint: null
```

- **`owner`** — identifies whose dataset this is. Use this when constructing intros, bios, or any context where "the user" needs to be referenced by their contact file.
- **`enclaves`** — optional. Only relevant if the user has joined a Peeps Enclave at peepsapp.ai for network requests federation.

### Enclave — Optional Network Feature

The enclave is an opt-in feature. The skill works fully without it.

If the user has joined a Peeps Enclave (peepsapp.ai), the enclave allows federation of requests in a trusted circle and querying across the group. All of this is optional, consensual, and revocable.

## Core Behavior

- User mentions a person → check if people contact exists, offer to create/update
- User asks "who do I know in [domain/skill/location]?" → search by acumen, interests, location
- User asks about someone → surface their file with relevant context
- User wants to make an intro → draft it using both contact files + owner profile

## When User Mentions Someone

- "Had coffee with Maria" → ask if any updates from her, update if anythign important
- "John's daughter is Sofia" → add to personal details
- "Sarah loves hiking" → add to interests/notes

## Creating a New Contact — Search First, Then Ask

Before asking follow-up questions, always search the web for the person (name + any context provided). Use what you find to pre-fill fields and make follow-up questions specific, not generic.

Example: "Found Peter on LinkedIn — design strategist, ex-Steelcase Asia Pacific in HK, now in SF. How do you know him, and is he open to intros?"

## Follow-Up Questions

After searching and pre-filling what you can, ask about the gaps:

1. **Relationship closeness** — How close are you? (e.g., close friend, acquaintance, professional contact, mentor)
2. **Open to introductions?** — Is this person open to being introduced to others? Any caveats?
3. **How you met** — if not already provided
4. **Interests** — hobbies, sports, lifestyle? (helps match people for non-work reasons)

Ask these as a short grouped follow-up (not one by one). Skip any that were already answered in the original message.

## Contact Structure

- One Markdown file per person: `maria-garcia.md`
- Sections: basics, relationship, personal details, notes or private notes (not both unless needed)
- Use **Notes** for general context worth remembering
- Use **Private Notes 🔒** for sensitive info (debts, conflicts, things not to share) — always separate
- No interaction history section — it goes stale fast. Capture what matters as a note instead.
- Keep it human-readable — this is about relationships, not data entry

## Key Fields To Capture

- Name, how you met, where they work/live
- **Relationship** (Close / Warm / Colleague / Acquaintance / Estranged / Family)
- **Intro willingness** (Open / Closed / Unknown)
- **Interests** — hobbies, sports, lifestyle (for non-work matching: running partners, travel buddies, etc.)
- **Acumen** — skills and expertise (for work/project matching)
- **Bio** — one concise narrative paragraph
- Birthday, anniversary, important dates → Notes
- Family members, kids, sensitive info → Private Notes 🔒

## Logging Interactions

Don't create an interaction history. Instead, update the person's Notes with whatever is worth remembering long-term. If it's not worth keeping, don't write it down.

Examples:

- "Going part-time at Foodpanda from mid-April, focusing on AI-native design systems" → Notes
- "Owes Ilya money, uncomfortable topic" → Private Notes 🔒
- "We had a coffee" → don't bother

## Progressive Enhancement

- Start by creating contacts as they come up naturally
- Enrich over time: add acumen, interests, intro willingness as you learn more
- Periodically review sparse contacts and fill the gaps by asking questions
- Capture details during conversations — don't wait for a "data entry session"

## What To Surface Proactively

- "Alex mentioned job hunting last time" — relevant context resurfacing
- "You haven't connected with Basel in a while" — if user wants relationship nudges

## Details Worth Remembering

- How you can help them / how they can help you
- Kids/spouse names and ages
- Recent life events: new job, moved, health issues
- Preferences: vegetarian, doesn't drink, early riser
- Sensitive topics to avoid

## What NOT To Suggest

- Syncing with phone contacts — different purpose, keep separate
- CRM-style pipeline tracking — this is personal, not sales
- Automated birthday messages — calendar does this job
- Social media integration — privacy and complexity

## Folder Structure

```
~/people/
├── maria-garcia.md
├── john-smith.md
└── deceased/         # for people who have passed
```

All contact files live directly in `~/.clawbot/workspace/people/`. Move people who passed to `deceased/`.

## Search and Retrieval

Use `grep` for fast fuzzy scanning across all contact files:

```bash
# Find anyone matching a name or keyword (case-insensitive)
grep -ril "keyword" ~/.clawbot/workspace/people/

# Show matching lines with context
grep -i "keyword" ~/.clawbot/workspace/people/*.md

# Find by company
grep -ril "hsbc" ~/.clawbot/workspace/people/

# Find open-to-intro contacts
grep -rl "Intor willingness.*Open" ~/.clawbot/workspace/people/

# Full text search with filename
grep -iH "keyword" ~/people/*.md
```

For fuzzy/approximate matching, use `grep -i` (case-insensitive) as the first pass.
